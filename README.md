PuppetFTP allows you to configure vsftpd and ProFTPD and tends to support more servers shortly.

With PuppetFTP, you will be able to set a lot of parameters for your server like internet protocol, the timeout (idle and data), the welcome message, etc. You will be able to manage the anonymous user and your virtual users. You will also be able to start, stop or restart your server. You will be able to export the current configuration in order to make backup or duplicate it on an other server with the import function.
